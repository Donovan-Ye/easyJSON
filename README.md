# easyJSON

JSON visualization desktop tool.

This is a encapsulated desktop version of [json4u](https://github.com/loggerhead/json4u?tab=readme-ov-file). I created this app because I didnt find any beautiful and easy to use json visualization tool on Mac.

# Features

Due to the limitation of time and my use case, I only implemented the basic features of json4u and added some features that I think are useful.

## Basic Features

- [x] JSON visualization
- [x] JSON comparison
- [x] JSON formatting

## Added Features

- [x] Auto paste json from clipboard
- [x] Global shortcut to open and paste json from clipboard
